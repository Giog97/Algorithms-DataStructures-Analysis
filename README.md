Welcome to **Algorithms and Data Structures Analysis**! 

🚀 This repository contains comparisons and analyses of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

## 📌 Contents

The repository includes:

- **Sorting Algorithms Comparison** 📊: A performance comparison between **Insertion Sort** and **Quick Sort**.
- **Binary Trees vs Red-Black Trees** 🌳: Analyzing the differences in performance, balancing, and use cases.
- **Union-Find on Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** 🔗: Evaluating Union-Find's role in MST algorithms.

## 📜 Report

The data are reported in pdf reports. Inside the folders there are also the files useful for writing the LaTeX of the report.

## 🤝 Contributions

This project was created by Giovanni Stefanini to study and analyze fundamental algorithms and data structures. This project was created to pass the algorithms and data structures exam at the University of Florence.
